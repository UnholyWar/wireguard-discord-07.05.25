Discord Traffic Tunneling with WireGuard
This setup allows users to route only Discord traffic through a WireGuard tunnel, while keeping the rest of the traffic unaffected. It is ideal for users who want to use Discord securely over a VPN while maintaining normal internet usage for other applications.

Prerequisites
WireGuard installed and configured on your system.

Basic understanding of WireGuard configuration and networking.

Steps to Set Up
Install WireGuard:
Ensure WireGuard is installed on your system. You can download it from WireGuard's official site.

Obtain Discord's IP Addresses:
You can obtain the necessary IP addresses that Discord uses by analyzing the network traffic through tools like Wireshark or using the netstat command on your machine when Discord is running.

Configure the WireGuard Tunnel:

Open your WireGuard configuration file (wg0.conf or similar).

Under the AllowedIPs section, add the IPs for Discord traffic. For example:

nginx
Kopyala
Düzenle
AllowedIPs = 3.233.0.0/16, 20.54.0.0/16, 199.232.0.0/16, 172.64.0.0/16, 162.159.0.0/16, 142.250.0.0/16, 104.18.0.0/16, 10.13.0.0/16
This ensures that only the specified IP ranges for Discord traffic will be routed through the WireGuard tunnel.

Apply the Configuration:
After editing the configuration, apply the changes:

Use the wg-quick up <your-config> command to bring up the tunnel.

Connect to Your VPN:
Connect to your WireGuard VPN. At this point, only Discord traffic will be routed through the VPN while other traffic will be routed normally.

Why Use This Setup?
Security: You can ensure that Discord traffic is secured via VPN, protecting it from potential threats.

Custom Routing: By only routing Discord traffic through the tunnel, you save bandwidth for other services and applications that don’t require a VPN.

Privacy: Discord’s network traffic can be tunneled through a trusted server for enhanced privacy and security.

Notes
Make sure to update your WireGuard configuration as Discord’s IP ranges may change over time.

This setup is ideal for users who want to use Discord securely but don’t want all their internet traffic to go through a VPN.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the following:

Ensure that the Discord IPs are correctly added to your WireGuard configuration.

Verify that your WireGuard service is active and correctly configured.

Use tools like ping or traceroute to verify if Discord’s traffic is correctly routed through the tunnel.
